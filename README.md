# The Bastards Book of Ruby

## Learning Goals

- Use Ruby as a swiss-army knife to accomplish tasks that don't fit squarely into 'programming'

## Introduction

Ruby can be used to do way more than just web applications with Rails.

[The Bastards Book of Ruby](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/) is an introduction to programming for people who want to get things done with data - scientists, journalists, researchers, analysts, etc. Most of the early chapters will be review for you, but it's worth moving through them quickly as a self-check. The most interesting parts will probably be the sections on manipulating files, CSV, web scraping, and image manipulation.

The book is slowly getting older, so you might have to adjust the code examples.
